<h2> Baleric Inc. Assesment:</h2>

Balearic Inc. faces critical issues with its current network configuration, including security, redundancy, and efficiency. The network's single core switch creates a single point of failure, making it highly susceptible to a DDoS attack that could halt all revenue generation and expose sensitive data. This configuration also lacks a robust data backup strategy; with backups not being stored off-site and not being performed frequently enough, the company is at risk of losing crucial client data due to natural disasters or other interruptions. Furthermore, the company's operational efficiency is low, as it relies on manual, command-line scripting for web application deployment and uses live production resources for testing patches, which increases the likelihood of errors and downtime.



Adopting a cloud infrastructure would effectively address these vulnerabilities and improve overall operations. A cloud-based solution provides enhanced security through features like load balancing and network segmentation, which can effectively defend against DDoS attacks. It also offers superior redundancy by allowing for off-site data backups across multiple geographic regions, protecting against data loss from localized events. Additionally, cloud services improve efficiency by enabling the use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform, which allows for a centralized codebase and the use of dedicated development environments to test patches safely before deployment, ultimately minimizing downtime and human error. While this transition would require an initial investment in specialized talent like cloud engineers, the long-term benefits in security, reliability, and operational efficiency would be substantial.

<h2> AWS Cloud Migration Proposal :</h2>

<b> Slide 1: Introduction/Executive Summary </b>

Current Infrastructure Challenges

Single Point of Failure: Core switch risks complete network outage

Disaster Recovery Risk: Backups are in the same location as primary data

Operational Inefficiency: Manual, script-based deployments

Security Concerns: Lack of centralized security management

Limited Scalability: Infrastructure cannot adapt to changing demands

AWS Value Proposition
Amazon Web Services offers a comprehensive cloud ecosystem to transform our technology stack from a cost center into a strategic business enabler.

Expected Outcomes

99.99% availability with multi-AZ deployments

Faster disaster recovery (RTO reduced to minutes)

50-60% reduction in deployment time via automation

30-40% optimization in infrastructure costs

Enhanced security posture with enterprise-grade tools

<b> Slide 2: Security Solution </b>

AWS Security Foundation

Secure Global Infrastructure: Built-in security at every layer

Continuous Monitoring & Threat Detection: AWS Security Hub, GuardDuty

Data Encryption: For data both in transit and at rest using AWS KMS

DDoS Protection: AWS Shield Standard and Advanced

Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Centralized Access Control: Fine-grained permissions and policies

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Required for all admin accounts

Directory Integration: Works with existing user directories

Compliance & Automation
Automated Compliance Checks: AWS Config rules

Inherited Compliance Certifications: SOC, ISO, PCI DSS

Automated Remediation: Event-driven responses to security findings

<b> Slide 3: Redundancy and High Availability </b>

AWS Global Infrastructure

Global Reach: 33 Regions, each with multiple Availability Zones (AZs)

Availability Zones: Physically separate data centers with independent power, cooling, and networking

Eliminates Single Points of Failure: Built-in redundancy at every level

Proposed High Availability Architecture

Multi-AZ Deployment: Automatic failover for critical services like databases (RDS)

Elastic Load Balancing: Distributes traffic across healthy instances

Auto Scaling Groups: Automatically maintains application health and availability

Disaster Recovery Strategies
Pilot Light: Minimal standby environment for critical systems

Warm Standby: Fully functional, scaled-down environment ready for production

Multi-Region Deployment: Highest level of availability for mission-critical apps

<b> Slide 4: Efficiency Gains Through Automation and Scaling </b>

DevOps and Automation

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Define and provision resources using code (AWS CloudFormation)

Consistent Environments: Eliminate "it works on my machine" problems

Version Control for Infrastructure: Track changes and roll back easily

AWS Developer Tools Suite
AWS CodePipeline: Automate the release pipeline

AWS CodeDeploy: Automate code deployments to instances

AWS CodeCommit: Secure, private Git repository

Auto Scaling Capabilities
Dynamic Scaling: Add/remove capacity based on real-time demand

Predictive Scaling: Use machine learning to forecast traffic and scale ahead of time

Cost Optimization: Automatically schedule resources to match business hours

<b> Slide 5: Cost Optimization Framework </b>

AWS Cost Management Strategies

Pay-as-You-Go: Only pay for what you use

Rightsizing: Match instance types to workload requirements

Eliminate Idle Resources: Automatically stop or terminate unused resources

Savings Plans & Discount Models
Savings Plans: Up to 66% savings for consistent compute usage

Reserved Instances: Significant discount for predictable workloads

Spot Instances: Up to 90% discount for flexible, interruptible workloads

Cost Monitoring & Governance
AWS Cost Explorer: Visualize and analyze costs and usage

AWS Budgets: Set custom cost and usage alerts

Resource Tagging: Track costs by department, project, or environment

<b> Slide 6: Next Steps and Implementation Plan </b>

Proposed Migration Approach

Assessment (30 days): Inventory applications and dependencies.

Proof of Concept (45 days): Migrate development/test environments.

Production Migration (90 days): Execute wave-based migration.

Optimization (Ongoing): Continuously improve the AWS environment.

Initial Action Items
Form an AWS migration team with key stakeholders.

Establish a secure AWS "Landing Zone."

Begin AWS training and knowledge transfer.

Identify 2-3 candidate applications for initial migration.

Measuring Success
KPI	Current Baseline	Target
Uptime %	99.5%	99.99%
Deployment Time	4-8 hours	<1 hour
Cost per User	$45/month	<$30/month

Conclusion
Migrating to AWS addresses our most critical infrastructure challenges and provides a foundation for innovation and growth.
